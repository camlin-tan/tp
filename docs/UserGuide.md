## Introduction
Welcome to HealthNote! This guide will help you get started.

### What is HealthNote?
HealthNote is a digital patient record manager. If you are an independent home healthcare provider, this is 
the perfect tool for you. HealthNote helps manage your patients' information, record their medical histories, and 
organise home visit notes. The simple and user-friendly interface enables you to access patient details 
faster than traditional patient files. With HealthNote, you can spend more time caring for your patients instead of 
combing through stacks of paperwork.

### Who this guide is for
This guide is written for medical professionals who are proficient with using a Command Line Interface (CLI).
We assume that you are familiar with your computer's operating system, navigating its files, and using its
CLI. Our goal is to quickly get you up and running by skipping over-simplified instructions.

## Getting Started

HealthNote requires **Java 17** to run. Please follow the instructions according to your computer's operating system.

### 1. Java version check and installation

**For macOS Users**

A specific Java `17` version is required.

1. Please follow the instructions [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
2. After completing the setup, open the **Terminal** app and run the command `java -version` to confirm that
   the correct version is installed, you should see a Java version starting with `17` (e.g., `17.0.5`).


**For Windows and Linux Users**
1. Open your system's CLI (e.g., PowerShell, Terminal).
2. Execute this command: `java -version`.
3. If the output shows a Java version starting with `17` (e.g., `17.0.5`), you already have the correct version
   installed and may skip to the [Downloading HealthNote](#2-downloading-healthnote) section. If not, keep following the instructions to install Java `17`.
4. Download Java `17` from [this website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-0-13-later-archive-downloads.html)
   according to your computer's operating system.
5. Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions.
6. After the installation, close and reopen your CLI, and repeat `step 2`.


### 2. Downloading HealthNote
Download the latest `healthnote.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases).


### 3. Running HealthNote
1. Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store your patient data and move the downloaded
   `healthnote.jar` into this new folder.
2. Open your CLI and navigate to this folder (using commands like `cd`).
3. Run this command: `java -jar healthnote.jar`
4. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

Congratulations! You are now ready to use HealthNote. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Interface

Here are the key components of the HealthNote User Interface (UI), designed for the convenience of our users.

![UI-components.png](images/UI-components.png)

| No | Component                                | Description                                                                                                                          |

## Features

### Command Format


In this section, we will break down the core components of a command in HealthNote. Understanding these components will help you input commands accurately and efficiently.

The command formats follow a general structure, containing a **command word**, **prefix** and **field**.

| Component        | Example       | Description                                                                                                      |
|------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Command Word** | `add`         | Specifies what task or action to perform.                                                                        |
| **Prefix**       | `n\`          | Indicates the specific field to be edited (e.g., name, phone number).                                            |
| **Field**        | `George Best` | Represents the data or value provided by the user, replacing the `UPPER_CASE` placeholder in the command format. |


For example, this is the command format for the `add` command: <br>

![command-format.png](images/command-format.png)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note**<br>

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME p\PHONE_NUMBER`, `p\PHONE_NUMBER n\NAME` is also acceptable.

</box>

<br>

In the command format, special symbols surrounding prefixes and fields indicate additional properties for the respective fields. Here’s a breakdown:

| **Symbol** | **Description**                                                            | **Example**             | **Interpretation**                               |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **None**   | **Required field**                                                         | `n\NAME`                | The patient's name is required.                  |
| **[ ]**    | **Optional field with a maximum of one entry**                             | `[ar\ALCOHOLIC_RECORD]` | The patient can have at most one alcohol record. |
| **[ ]...** | **Optional field with no limit on the number of entries (including zero)** | `[t\TAG]...`            | The patient can have multiple tags.              |

<box type="info" seamless>

**Example:**

* `n\NAME [t\TAG]` can be used as `n\John Doe t\VIP` or as `n\John Doe`.

* `[t\TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t\VIP`, `t\VIP t\Urgent` etc.

</box>

<br>

<box type="info" seamless>

**More notes about the command formats:**<br>

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* You can view a summary of all the command formats [here](#command-summary).

* You can view a summary of all the fields' input constraints [here](#input-constraints-table).

Format: `edit INDEX [n\NAME] [id\IDENTITY_NUMBER] [p\PHONE] [e\EMAIL] [addr\ADDRESS]
 [ec\EMERGENCY_CONTACT] [dob\DATE_OF_BIRTH] [b\BLOOD_TYPE] [ar\ALCOHOLIC_RECORD] [g\GENDER] [sr\SMOKING_RECORD] 
 [pmh\PAST_MEDICAL_HISTORY] [t\TAG]... [al\ALLERGY]... [m\MEDICINE]...`

* Edits the patient at the specified `INDEX`. 
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list. 
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the patient will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative. This applies to medicines and allergies as well. <br>
  e.g. If a patient at `INDEX` 3 has the allergies "nuts" and "eggs", performing `edit 3 al\Penicillin` will replace all that patient's allergies with "Penicillin" only.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**ℹ️ Info:**<br>

## Features - Data Management

### Saving the data

HealthNote data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HealthNote data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/healthnote.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**❗Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HealthNote will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the HealthNote to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

### Data Management
**Q**: How do I change the location of the data file?<br>
**A**: Currently, HealthNote does not support changing the data file location. The data file is always stored in `[JAR file location]/data/healthnote.json`.
<box type="tip" seamless>

**Extra notes:** For pro-users, you may change the data path in `preferences.json` file located in `[JAR file location]/preferences.json`. However, this is not officially supported and may lead to unexpected behaviour.
</box>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the auto created `healthnote.json` it creates with the `healthnote.json` from your previous HealthNote `folder/data`.

**Q**: May I edit the data file manually?<br>
**A**: Manual editing of the data file is possible but not recommended unless you are confident in maintaining the correct JSON format. Incorrect edits may lead to empty data loaded when HealthNote start up.

### Common Issues
**Q**: Can I undo a delete or clear action?<br>
**A**: No, once a record is deleted or cleared, the data is permanently removed. It is recommended to back up your data file `healthnote.json` regularly.

**Q**: Can I open multiple HealthNote windows at the same time?<br>
**A**: Running multiple instances of the app is not supported. Doing so may cause data conflicts. Use only one window at a time.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will be focused, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
