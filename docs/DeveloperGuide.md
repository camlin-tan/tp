## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java).

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Appointment` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` and `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object and an `UniqueAppointmentList` object).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* each `Person` and `Appointment` store a common reference of `IdentityNumber`

The object diagram below illustrates the important parts of how `ModelManager` is structured and how `UI` interacts with it.

<puml src="diagrams/ModelUiObjectDiagram.puml" width="1000" />

The `ModelManager`,

* stores a list of `Person` objects called `FilteredPersonList`. This is the list that is displayed in the `PersonListPanel` in `UI`
* stores 2 lists of `Appointments` objects sorted by time, one which is `SortedAllUpcomingAppointments` and another `SortedAllPastAppointments`. These are the lists displayed by `AppointmentListPanel` in `UI`
* stores a `Person` object called `ViewedPerson` which is the person currently being viewed in the `PersonViewPanel` in `UI`
* stores another 2 lists of `Appointments` objects filtered to current `ViewedPerson` object, one is `SortedViewedPersonUpcomingAppointments` and `SortedViewPersonPastAppointments`
* exposes the above components to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList`s and `ObservableValue` that can be 'observed'. The UI components are bound to them and automatically update when the data changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The above object diagram does not follow the conventional pattern as everything shown above follows a singleton pattern, where only one instance of its class should exist. 

</box>

**Note:** The above diagrams are simplified to show the most important components and their main associations. Below is a detailed class diagram of Person and Appointment.

<puml src="diagrams/PersonAndAppointmentClassDiagram.puml" width="1000" />

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. Where `ViewedPerson` stores a reference to the currently viewed `Person` and all their `Appointments` in the necessary order.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/ViewedPersonClassDiagram.puml" width="500" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Design considerations**

### Input Validation Rationale

Our input validation is designed to be flexible and user-centred, avoiding overzealous validation that blocks legitimate inputs. 
Since doctors often need to record varied and free-form information, we only reject inputs that would cause functional issues (e.g. empty required fields or unparseable dates) while allowing all other characters and symbols.

For fields marked “must not be blank”, any non-empty input is accepted, allowing symbols such as `*`, `/`, `[ ]`, `{ }`, `#`, and `&`. **This is intentional, and not a feature flaw, nor an oversight in our design consideration.**
This enables users to record data naturally (e.g. Fracture* – left arm, [Mother] 9888-3333 (Office)) without being restricted by unnecessary formatting rules.

In contrast, structured fields like identity number, email, date of birth, and appointment date/time apply format checks only to ensure application operations such as searching, parsing, and sorting remain reliable.

Overall, our approach is to be permissive unless functionality is at risk. We will not restrict values if doing so does not add operational benefit.
This strikes a balance between robustness and usability, preventing over-restriction while keeping data entry smooth and efficient for real-world medical use.

| **Field**                     | **Allowed Example Inputs (with symbols & numbers)**                                    | **Justification and Real-World Basis**                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **n\NAME**                    | `Dr. Alex (Sr.)`, `John Paul the 2nd`, `Damith s/o Sankar-Ashish`, `X Æ A-Xii`         | Real names may include titles, numbers, and punctuation (e.g. *Pope John Paul II*, *Damith s/o Sankar-Ashish*). Allowing all symbols and digits supports inclusivity and accurate record-keeping with flexibility. |
| **id\IDENTITY_NUMBER**        | `S1234567A`, `060402-06-6767`, `A.1234.567`                                            | Identity numbers across systems (passport, hospital, national) may contain letters, digits, hyphens, and dots. Allowing these ensures flexibility while maintaining parseable structure.         |
| **p\PHONE_NUMBER**            | `9888-3333 (Office)`, `[Home] 6222*3333`, `+65 8123 4567`                              | Phone entries often include country codes, separators, or contextual notes. Requiring only two consecutive digits ensures validity without limiting natural formatting.                          |
| **e\EMAIL**                   | `nurse.jane_doe+ward@clinic.com`, `dr.lee77@hospital.sg`                               | `+`, `_`, `.`, and digits are valid in real institutional emails (e.g. `alex+lab@hospital.org`). Restricting them would wrongly reject legitimate addresses.                                       |
| **addr\HOME_ADDRESS**         | `#02-123 Blk 45 Clementi Rd`, `{Unit 3B} 88 Hilltop Ave`                               | Addresses use `#`, `-`, numbers, and brackets (e.g. *#02-45 Blk 88*). These are standard in local and international postal formats.                                                              |
| **ec\EMERGENCY_CONTACT**      | `[Mother] 9888-3333 (Office)`, `[Dr. Tan {Clinic}] 9000-1111`, `[Friend 2] 9333-2222`  | Emergency contacts often include relationship labels or numbering. The flexible format `[relationship] number` mirrors real hospital data entry patterns.                                        |
| **dob\DATE_OF_BIRTH**         | `12/10/1987`, `5.5.2000`, `23-09-1975`                                                 | Restricting to numeric formats with `-`, `/`, or `.` ensures proper parsing while supporting international date conventions.                                                                     |
| **b\BLOOD_TYPE**              | `A+`, `A Rh(D)−`, `Bombay (hh)`, `A/B`, `A*`, `B?`, `Rh(- -)`                          | Blood typing notation often includes symbols like `+`, `-`, `/`, `()`, `*`, and `?` to mark antigen variants, uncertainty, or subgroups (e.g. `A3`, `Rh(- -)`). Allowing such inputs prevents rejection of legitimate lab formats. |
| **g\GENDER**                  | `Male`, `Female`, `Non-binary`, `X`, `M/F`, `M→F`, `Trans♀`, `Other (specify: &fluid)` | Gender identity and administrative codes can include symbols, arrows, or parentheses (e.g. `M→F`, `X`, `Trans*`). Supporting these improves inclusivity and aligns with modern EHR standards (e.g. Epic, Cerner). |
| **ar\ALCOHOLIC_RECORD**       | `None`, `2–3x/week`, `Quit & Recovered`, `Occasional (1 glass)`                        | Lifestyle entries often include numbers and punctuation for frequency or context. Flexibility improves expressiveness in clinical notes.                                                         |
| **sr\SMOKING_RECORD**         | `Quit (2010)`, `Occasional / Social`, `2/day`                                          | Smoking history fields commonly use digits for frequency or cessation year, and symbols like `/` or `()`.                                                                                        |
| **pmh\PAST_MEDICAL_HISTORY**  | `Asthma (mild)`, `Fracture* – left arm`, `Type-2 Diabetes`                             | Medical conditions often contain digits or shorthand symbols (e.g. `Type-2`, `Stage III`). Allowing punctuation supports real medical documentation.                                             |
| **t\TAG**                     | `[Follow-Up]`, `VIP*`, `{HighRisk-3}`, `Urgent #2`                                     | Tags may include brackets, hashes, or numbers for sorting or prioritisation. Flexible tagging supports varied hospital workflows.                                                                |

Such notation reflects real-world allergy charting.                                                                     |

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level
The difficulty of this project was high. The most difficult feature to implement was the `Appointments` feature,
as it required transitioning AB3 from a single-entity to a multi-entity application. In AB3, only `Person`
objects were involved whereas in HealthNote, both `Person` and `Appointment` objects are created, displayed, and used
simultaneously. Adding a new section to the UI to display these appointments required new internal lists within 
`Model` and new methods to manage them as well.

Linking each `Person` to their corresponding `Appointment`(s) introduced another layer of complexity, as changes to a 
`Person` object would also affect their associated `Appointment`(s). For example, when a `Person` is deleted from the `Person List`, 
all of their related `Appointment`s must also be deleted from the Appointments list. 


### Challenges Faced
Our team faced several technical and workflow challenges:

**Initial Learning Curve**: As a team new to a large codebase, the initial learning curve was steep. We had to quickly
learn and understand the design patterns, such as the MVC and Observer pattern used in AB3, before they were covered
in the weekly topics. This required a lot of planning and justification of our design choices in order to ensure that 
the existing design of AB3 was not broken. 


**Adhering to Design**: We spent a considerable amount of time planning and justifying our design choices to ensure 
that the existing design of AB3 was not broken. For example, our view command required `UI` to interact with `Logic` 
and `Model` to display a specific `Person` in the new `PersonViewPanel` without violating the `MVC` pattern. We had to 
carefully plan how the selected `Person` to be viewed would be passed from `Model` to `UI` and how the `MainWindow` 
would be updated.


**Cascading Test Failures**: The massive number of tests used in AB3 meant that simple changes to commonly used classes
such as those in `command` and `person` broke over 50 JUnit tests at once, all of which had to be manually traced
and updated. 


**Parallel Branches and Merge Conflicts**: Our team worked on multiple features in parallel. Adding numerous new fields
to `Person` in separate pull requests created a large number of merge conflicts, mostly involving the edited JUnit tests. 
Resolving these conflicts was very tedious and time-consuming as we could not simply accept the incoming or current 
branch without editing the code manually.


### Effort Required
We iterated on the four main AB3 components, which saved us the effort of building a functional address book
from the ground up. However, the effort in adapting it to HealthNote was still substantial. 

**Model**: We modified the `Person` class significantly, adding many new fields that fit our target user such as `BloodType`, 
`PastMedicalHistory`, and `Allergy`. We also designed and implemented new entities, including `Appointment` and 
`AppointmentList`.

**Storage**: We created a new `JsonAdaptedAppointment` class to store appointments locally, and updated the 
`JsonAdaptedPerson` class for our new fields.

**Logic**: We wrote new Command and Parser classes for all new features, such as `AddAppointmentCommand`, 
`DeleteUpcomingAppointmentCommand`, `DeletePastAppointmentCommand`, `ViewCommand`, and `ThemeCommand`.

**UI**: We created several new UI components to display the appointment list and patient information. This includes
the `AppointmentCard`, `AppointmentListPanel`, and `PersonViewPanel` for the `view` command.

**Testing**: A large portion of our effort was dedicated to testing. This involved updating hundreds of existing
AB3 tests to work with our new Person model and writing more testcases to test our new commands, parsers and model classes.


### Achievements
Despite the challenges, our team successfully:

- Transformed AB3 from a generic address book into a specialized, domain-specific application for home healthcare providers.
- Designed and implemented a relational data model, successfully linking Patient entities to their corresponding Appointments.
- Mastered and extended the AB3 architecture, applying its design patterns to new and complex features.
- Delivered an extensive and useful feature set for our target user, such as patient medical records, appointment 
management and a detailed patient view panel. We also added different themes to enhance the overall user experience and aesthetics.


## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team Size: 5

1. **Save user set theme**:
   In the current implementation, if the user has set a theme, by executing the command: `theme pink` for example, the set
   theme does not persist once the user exits and relaunches the application. We plan to store the user set theme in
   `UserPrefs`. When the application launches, the user's theme will be fetched and set during UI initialisation.
   When the user sets a new theme, this data will be updated.


2. **More specific error message for `schedule` command**:
   The current error message when the `schedule` command is executed with missing or invalid parameters is
   `Invalid Command Format!` and it is too general. We plan to make the error message mention the reason for failure.
   These reasons for failure include missing parameters, or invalid parameters provided.
   For example: `Command could not be executed due to missing parameter: adt\` or `Command could not be executed due to
unrecognised parameter(s): a\, b\ `


3. **Warn Overlapping Appointments:**
   The current implementation allows the user to create two different appointments at the same time and date for
   **different patients.** For example, an appointment may be scheduled for patient `A` at time `25-08-2025 20:00`,
   and another appointment for the same time may also be scheduled for another patient `B`. We did not stop this from
   happening as it could be the intended action of the user. However, there is also a possibility that the user had
   overlooked their schedule and did not intend to add two different appointments with the same time. Therefore, we plan
   to add a message to notify the user if this occurs.
